What could be more **meta** than writing my first blog post about setting up my blog?

## Set up Blogdown

The first step was to create the site as described in [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). 

To install the latest version of blogdown, I ran the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

I decided on the [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) theme, created a new project named `cellsgenesanddata`, and started writing this post using the `New Post` add-in.

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com) is an awesome workflow since it enforces version control, and whenever I push a change to my GitHub account, Netlify will automatically update and publish my website.

Here are the steps I followed:

1. On GitHub, create a new public repository named `cellsgenesanddata`. 
2. Tell RStudio that I want this project under version control with `git`: **Tools** → **Project Options** → **Git/SVN** → **Git**.
3.  
- On Netlify, create a new site from Git: **New site from Git** → **GitHub** → **Only select repositories** → `skadauke/cellsgenesanddata` → 




## Configuration

There are a couple of files I didn't want to add to the repository. The `public/` folder holds the rendered page, which is not necessary since Netlify renders its own version. The `blogdown/` folder contains cache files that do not need to be subject to version control. Also, it is poor form to share your operating system’s cache files.

Here are the contents of my `.gitignore` file:

```{}
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata

/public
/blogdown

# OS files
.DS_Store
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
Thumbs.db
```
